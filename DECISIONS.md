# DECISIONS.md

Judgment calls made during the build. Newest last. Each: what, why, what the
alternative was. Operator-confirmed items are marked ✅; assumptions still needing
a ruling are marked ⚠️.

---

**D1 — Python tooling lives in `Hubspot/`, not `portal/`.** ✅ operator-confirmed 10 Aug 2026

`PORTAL_PLAN.md` places `seed_from_csv.py`, `sync_hubspot.py`, and `admin/app.py`
under `portal/`. But this repo's root is the Netlify publish directory, so a
committed `.py` file is served as downloadable text — the exact Phase 0 risk.
`.gitignore` now blocks `*.py` here. Alternative considered: un-ignore `portal/*.py`
and rely on `_redirects` to block them. Rejected — a gitignore that fails closed
beats an edge rule that must be maintained. The plan's file paths are superseded
on this point only; everything else in the layout stands.

---

**D2 — `_redirects` blocks portal source files from being served.** ✅ operator-confirmed 10 Aug 2026

`schema.sql` documents the tables and every RLS policy — a map for anyone probing
the portal. `robots.txt` only asks politely. Netlify's `_redirects` enforces it at
the edge with no build step. Alternative: keep the SQL outside the repo entirely.
Rejected — the plan wants the schema in version control, and it is the main SQL
learning artifact.

---

**D3 — `activity_type_aliases` table added, beyond the plan.** ⚠️ new structure

The plan specifies `activity_type` as a lookup table. The live exports contain 23
distinct spellings for ~15 real activities (`Account Visit` / `account visit (PK)`,
`Drink List 1` / `drink list 2` / `drink list N/C`). A second table maps every raw
HubSpot string to a canonical type, so the loader can *fail loudly* on an unseen
value instead of dropping it. Alternative: clean the strings inside the loader.
Rejected — the mapping is data that changes, not logic; in a table it is
inspectable and editable without touching code.

---

**D4 — Activity taxonomy is admin-managed at runtime; imports never hard-fail on an unknown type.** ✅ operator-directed 10 Aug 2026

Superseded the original question. The operator's ruling: the activity vocabulary
("account sold", "case sold" and the rest) is *going to change*, so the system
must let an admin add and adjust types rather than have the mapping settled in
SQL by us. Individual mapping calls are explicitly not worth resolving now.

Built to match:
- `resolve_activity_type(raw)` — looks up the alias table; on an unknown value it
  creates the type, flags it `needs_review`, records the alias, and returns it. An
  undefined activity type can never cost a row. Blank/NULL routes to a single
  `unclassified` type instead of inventing one per empty value.
- `merge_activity_type(source, target)` — folds one type into another, moving
  activities *and* aliases, retiring the source rather than deleting it so the
  merge is reversible and no foreign key breaks. Re-importing the old raw string
  afterwards follows the merge instead of resurrecting the source.
- `v_activity_types_needing_review` — the admin's review queue, with the raw
  spellings each type has been seen as and how many activities it holds.

Both functions are `revoke`d from `public`/`anon`/`authenticated`: Postgres grants
EXECUTE to PUBLIC on new functions by default, which would have let any logged-in
brand user create activity types. The review queue view is staff-only for the same
reason. Tested — a brand login is refused on both functions.

---

**D5 — No write policies anywhere; the portal is structurally read-only.**

RLS is enabled with `SELECT` policies only, so all writes from the portal's
`anon`/`authenticated` keys are denied by default. Writes happen via the
`service_role` key from the Streamlit admin and the sync script, which bypass RLS.
Alternative: write policies scoped by brand. Rejected as premature — nothing in
Phases 1–5 needs a brand user to write. Phase 6 field entry adds them
deliberately, one at a time.

---

**D6 — Verified on local Postgres 18, not Supabase Postgres 15.** ⚠️ VERIFICATION GAP

`bash portal/test/run.sh` proves the schema applies, is idempotent, and that RLS
isolates brands — on a local cluster with a hand-written stub for `auth.users`,
`auth.uid()`, and `storage.*`. It does **not** prove behaviour on Supabase. The
playbook (Part 5.3) requires verification on the real target. Closing this needs a
Supabase project, which needs an account the operator must create. Until then,
Phase 1 is "verified locally", not "verified".

---

**D7 — Trigger derives `brand_venue_status` from activity type, ignoring deal stage.** ✅ operator-confirmed 10 Aug 2026

`sync_brand_venue_status()` advances a venue to `pitched` on any activity and
`placed` on a depletion activity, and never overwrites the human judgements
(`reordering`, `dormant`, `lost`). But HubSpot already carries deal stages
(`Closed won`, `Finalizing terms`, `Objection handling`, …) that are better signal
and are currently unused. Left out because the stage→status mapping is one of the
plan's own open questions and guessing it would bake in a wrong answer quietly.

---

**D8 — `python-dotenv` added as a dependency.**

The playbook treats dependencies as liabilities. This one is ~30 lines of
equivalent hand-rolled parsing, is the near-universal convention, and touches only
local scripts — not the deployed site, which has no dependencies at all. Added to
`Hubspot/automate_hurry/requirements.txt`.

---

**D9 — `anon` lockdown placed at the end of `schema.sql`.**

Supabase's default privileges grant `anon` access to newly created objects in
`public`. Revoking mid-file would miss everything defined after that point,
including the three dashboard views. The revoke plus `alter default privileges`
runs last so it catches all of it, and stops future objects reopening the hole.
